Radio burst detector development by Caltech Ay122b class

## 1. Introduction

We will be building and testing a stripped-down version of the STARE-2 bright FRB detector. This will involve a selection of tasks, which we will do in groups:
1. **Feed and LNA testing.** Characterize total and LNA noise temperatures, frequency response, LNA compression point.
2. **Mixer block design and construction.** Design integrated device for downconversion and signal conditioning. Purchase and assemble Minicircuits components, test device. 
3. **RF noise source design and construction.** Design a calibrated noise source with a variable attenuator, for the purposes of testing. Purchase and assemble Minicircuits components, test device. 
4. **Bring up and test SNAP-1.** Program a SNAP-1 board. Adapt control / monitoring software, verify performance.
5. **Data capture and analysis software.** Adapt software to capture voltage data and process as required.
